The project evaluates betting strategies on baseball series outcomes, especially between the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees. It calculates win probabilities and potential betting returns, factoring in home advantage and statistical analysis to forecast financial outcomes.

The project analyzes betting strategies within the context of a series of baseball games between the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees, focusing on the calculation of winning probabilities and expected monetary outcomes based on various game outcomes. It begins with determining the Red Sox's probability of winning a three-game series under specific conditions, such as the location of the games and the inherent win probabilities of each team on their home ground. Through detailed calculations, the project finds that the probability of the Red Sox winning the series varies depending on the sequence and location of the wins, highlighting the significant impact of home advantage on game outcomes.

Further, the project delves into the financial aspect of betting on the series, employing statistical methods to forecast the net win distribution from betting on the Red Sox under the given probabilities. By simulating bets with fixed amounts for wins and losses, it calculates expected means, variances, and standard deviations for different game sequences, offering insights into the potential financial returns from betting strategies. Additionally, the analysis extends to generating random numbers to model betting outcomes, resulting in a 95% confidence interval for expected wins. This comprehensive approach not only assesses the probability of sports outcomes but also explores the associated risk and return of betting on these events, providing a nuanced understanding of sports betting dynamics.
